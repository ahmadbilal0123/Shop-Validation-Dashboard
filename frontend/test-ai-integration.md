# AI Detection Integration Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing the AI Detection Integration

### Backend Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added `@google-cloud/vision` dependency
2. ✅ Updated shop model with AI detection fields
3. ✅ Created AI detection service (`Backend/utils/aiDetection.js`)
4. ✅ Integrated AI detection into `uploadVisitPictures` controller
5. ✅ Added new API endpoint: `GET /api/shops/ai-detection/:shopId`
6. ✅ Added environment variable: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY`

### Frontend Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added AI detection API function to `lib/api.ts`
2. ✅ Updated reports page with AI detection column and summary
3. ✅ Updated shop details page with comprehensive AI detection section

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
```

### 2. Add Environment Variable to Railway
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Navigate to your project settings
- Add environment variable: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY=AIzaSyDvEOdOU5EeOA-MmZzFOElzh6s7tmmLVpY`

### 3. Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add AI detection for Lay's products using Google Cloud Vision API"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Railway Auto-Deploy
- Railway will automatically detect changes and redeploy
- New dependencies will be installed automatically
- Database schema will be updated automatically

## 🧪 Testing the Integration:

### Test 1: Reports Page (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/reports`)
1. Navigate to the reports page
2. Look for the new "AI Detection" column in the table
3. For shops with visits, you should see:
   - "Load AI" button for shops without AI data
   - AI detection results for shops with AI data
4. Check the new AI Detection summary card showing shops with Lay's detected

### Test 2: Shop Details Page (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard/shops/68c91e8096ae03e6550418c4`)
1. Navigate to a shop details page
2. Look for the new "AI Detection Results" section
3. If the shop has visit images, you should see:
   - "Load AI Analysis" button
   - After clicking, comprehensive AI detection results including:
     - Summary statistics (Lay's detected, confidence, visits analyzed)
     - Detection methods used
     - Visit-by-visit analysis
     - Logo detections with confidence scores
     - Extracted text from images

### Test 3: Backend API
Test the new API endpoint directly:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/shops/ai-detection/68c91e8096ae03e6550418c4" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### When AI Detection Works:
- ✅ Lay's products are detected in shelf images
- ✅ Confidence scores are displayed (0-100%)
- ✅ Detection methods are shown (logo, text, object, none)
- ✅ Bounding boxes are drawn on detected logos
- ✅ Extracted text from images is displayed
- ✅ Summary statistics are calculated

### When No Lay's Detected:
- ❌ Shows "No Lay's" with red X icon
- ❌ Confidence shows 0%
- ❌ Detection method shows "none"

### Error Handling:
- 🔄 Loading states with spinners
- ⚠️ Graceful fallbacks if AI detection fails
- 📝 Error messages in console for debugging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### If AI Detection Doesn't Work:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Check if images are accessible via Cloudinary URLs
4. Verify Google Cloud Vision API quota/billing

### If Frontend Shows Errors:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify JWT token is valid
3. Check if backend is running and accessible

## 📊 Data Flow:

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads shop/shelf images via visit form
2. **AI Processing**: Backend automatically runs Google Cloud Vision API
3. **Data Storage**: AI results stored in MongoDB with visit record
4. **Frontend Display**: Reports and shop details pages show AI results
5. **Real-time Updates**: AI data loads on-demand for better performance

## 🎉 Success Indicators:

- ✅ Reports page shows AI detection column with data
- ✅ Shop details page shows comprehensive AI analysis
- ✅ Lay's products are accurately detected
- ✅ Confidence scores are reasonable (>70% for good detections)
- ✅ No console errors or API failures
- ✅ Smooth user experience with loading states

The integration is now complete and ready for testing! 🚀
