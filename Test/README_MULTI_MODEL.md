# Enhanced Lay's Detection System

## Overview
This enhanced system combines multiple AI models to provide robust detection of Lay's chips products with improved accuracy and reduced false positives.

## Available Versions

### 1. Original System (`app.py`)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Models**: OWL-ViT only
- **Features**: Basic detection with improved NMS
- **Status**: ✅ Working

### 2. Multi-Model System (`multi_model_app.py`) 
- **Port**: 5002
- **Models**: OWL-ViT + PaddleOCR
- **Features**: 
  - Enhanced OWL-ViT detection with more prompts
  - OCR verification to confirm "Lay's" text
  - Better duplicate detection filtering
  - Visual indicators for OCR verification
- **Status**: ✅ Ready to test

### 3. Full Ensemble System (`enhanced_app.py`)
- **Port**: 5001
- **Models**: OWL-ViT + Grounding DINO + PaddleOCR + SAM2
- **Features**: Complete ensemble detection
- **Status**: ⚠️ Requires additional setup

## Quick Start

### Test Multi-Model System (Recommended)
```bash
python multi_model_app.py
```
Then visit: http://localhost:5002

### Test Original System
```bash
python app.py
```
Then visit: http://localhost:5000

## Key Improvements in Multi-Model System

1. **Enhanced Detection Prompts**: 8 specific prompts instead of 3
2. **OCR Verification**: Confirms "Lay's" text in detected regions
3. **Visual Feedback**: Shows OCR status and extracted text
4. **Better Filtering**: Removes detections that don't contain Lay's text
5. **Improved NMS**: Better duplicate detection removal

## How It Works

1. **OWL-ViT Detection**: Uses multiple specific prompts to detect Lay's products
2. **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Removes overlapping detections
3. **OCR Verification**: Reads text in each detection to confirm it's Lay's
4. **Final Filtering**: Only keeps detections with verified Lay's text

## Expected Results

- **Before**: 2 detections (whole bag + chips illustration)
- **After**: 1 detection (only the verified Lay's bag)
- **Confidence**: Higher accuracy with OCR verification
- **False Positives**: Significantly reduced

## Troubleshooting

If PaddleOCR fails to load:
- The system will still work with OWL-ViT only
- OCR verification will be skipped
- You'll see "OCR not available" in the results

## Next Steps

1. Test with your problematic Lay's image
2. Compare results between original and multi-model versions
3. Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
4. Consider adding Grounding DINO for even better detection
